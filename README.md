## About Snickers the Corgi

Snickers is a very joyful and friendly dog, who loves to eat and not a secret that he has rather a chubby shape.

## Description

Snickers's puppy was stolen just right when it was born by poachers! 
To help Snickers you need to look after the baby corgi til Snickers will be able to rescue him.

First of all, you are honoured to give puppy a name as it was stolen even before it was named!
Moreover, you have to make sure that following conditions were applied to keep baby corgi alive:

- to feed the puppy so its hunger doesn't exceed 10;
- to walk it to keep fitness no lower than 0;

If you manage to do it for 30 days Snickers will be able to rescue him!

Best of luck!
